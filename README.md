# miniTorch

miniTorch is a minimal, educational deep learning framework inspired by PyTorch, designed for learning and experimentation. It provides a NumPy-based tensor engine, autograd, neural network modules, and basic optimizers, making it easy to understand the core concepts behind modern deep learning libraries.



## ‚ú® Features
- NumPy-based tensor operations with broadcasting
- Autograd (automatic differentiation) support
- Neural network modules (Linear, Activation, Sequential, etc.)
- Basic optimizers (SGD, etc.)
- Custom loss functions (MSELoss, etc.)
- Utilities for data loading and batching
- Easy-to-read code for educational purposes

## üöÄ Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Umang-Shikarvar/miniTorch
cd miniTorch
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## üìö Usage

To use `minitorch` as a library in your own projects, install it in editable mode:
```bash
pip install -e ./minitorch
```
This allows you to import `minitorch` from anywhere in your environment and automatically picks up code changes.
